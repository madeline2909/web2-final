            <h2>World Youth Wildlife Summit 2021 and Beyond…</h2>
            <p id="section-3-article5">
                Project Rhino will, with organising partners, once again host a World Youth Wildlife Summit in July 2021 at the Southern African Wildlife College. While there are plenty of environmental issues at hand, the Summit will retain a focus on the poaching and illegal trade of specific African species (terrestrial and marine) while addressing the underlying issues and potential solutions: responsible use, habitat loss, socio-economic factors and education and awareness.
            </p>
            <p id="section-3-article6">
                The theme of the Summit will be ‘Empowering for Change’ and the programme, while similar to that of the previous event, will provide the youth with more time to express their ideas and questions as well as emphasise leadership tools and skills the youth can utilise in their post-summit pledges.
